      <p>The WordPress community in the UK is on Slack. </p>

<h2>
<a id="what-is-slack" class="anchor" href="#what-is-slack" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Slack?</h2>

<p>In a nutshell <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> is an online chat service for teams. After many years of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>, the <a href="http://WordPress.org">WordPress.org</a> team moved all of their conversations onto Slack. This has made having conversations to do with the WordPress.org project much easier to have, regardless of technical abiity. You can read more about their decision at <a href="http://chat.wordpress.org">chat.wordpress.org</a></p>

<p>With Slack you can create your own team, and within that team, have multiple channels. It may be helpful to look at it like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Slack was a block of flats, every <em>team</em> is a flat, and every <em>channel</em> is a room within that flat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just like a flat in real life, each team has its own key to get in. We will discuss how to get onto the WP Community UK slack team later. </p>

<p>WP Community UK, is the team name for the UK WordPress community on Slack. It is currently primarily being used to help support and sustain the many WordPress community organisers up and down the country. This tends to be in the form of discussions around venues, speakers, sponsorship and general discussions about running a group.</p>

<p>In the team, you will also find individual channels for all the WordPress groups, where you will find friendly faces from your local events. The team also enables you to talk with other groups - find out other places to go, other ideas/suggestions for meetings. You can also get involved with the WordCamps and any other WordPress events that are are being organised around the country.</p>

<p>We also use the space to discuss UK specific issues and ideas. Example topics include our banking system, UK legal issues, and how our lovely government is changing the laws that effects us as freelancers, businesses, and employees. </p>

<h3>
<a id="what-it-is-not" class="anchor" href="#what-it-is-not" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What it is not</h3>

<p><a href="http://wp-community-uk.slack.com">wp-community-uk.slack.com</a> is not a WordPress support channel and we are not in favour of seperating ourselves from the greater WordPress community. </p>

<p></p>This is not to say we don't get questions on issues to do with WordPress, but we highly recommend you visit the WordPress <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/">support forums</a> or <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wordpress">online chatroom</a>.

<p>When you create a team, Slack only allows you to add new members in two predefined ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Invitation only - where as a user you would have to ask for an invitation.</li>
<li>Using an email address from a particular domain.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a group, we choose to minic the same standards as the global WordPress team. This also means you now have access to the global WordPress slack team. </p>

<p>For each Slack team you need to have an account. </p>

<p>We know, it's a pain. At least we only have to go through this process once! </p>
