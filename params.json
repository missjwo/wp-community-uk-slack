{"name":"WP Community UK Slack","tagline":"Explaination of how to get on the WP Community UK team","body":"# [wp-community-uk.slack.com](http://wp-community-uk.slack.com)\r\n\r\nThe WordPress community in the UK is on Slack. \r\n\r\n## What is Slack?\r\nIn a nutshell [Slack](https://slack.com/) is an online chat service for teams. After many years of [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), the [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org) team moved all of their conversations onto Slack. This has made having conversations to do with the WordPress.org project much easier to have, regardless of technical abiity. You can read more about their decision at [chat.wordpress.org](http://chat.wordpress.org)\r\n\r\nWith Slack you can create your own team, and within that team, have multiple channels. It may be helpful to look at it like this:\r\n\r\n>If Slack was a block of flats, every *team* is a flat, and every *channel* is a room within that flat.\r\n\r\nJust like a flat in real life, each team has its own key to get in. We will discuss how to get onto the WP Community UK slack team later. \r\n\r\n## [wp-community-uk.slack.com](http://wp-community-uk.slack.com)?\r\nWP Community UK, is the team name for the UK WordPress community on Slack. It is currently primarily being used to help support and sustain the many WordPress community organisers up and down the country. This tends to be in the form of discussions around venues, speakers, sponsorship and general discussions about running a group.\r\n\r\nIn the team, you will also find individual channels for all the WordPress groups, where you will find friendly faces from your local events. The team also enables you to talk with other groups - find out other places to go, other ideas/suggestions for meetings. You can also get involved with the WordCamps and any other WordPress events that are are being organised around the country.\r\n\r\nWe also use the channel to discuss UK specific issues and ideas. Example topics include our  banking system, UK legal issues, and how our lovely government is changing the laws that effects us as freelancers, businesses, and employees. \r\n\r\n### What it is not\r\n[wp-community-uk.slack.com](http://wp-community-uk.slack.com) is not a WordPress support channel and we are not in favour of seperating ourselves from the greater WordPress community. \r\n\r\nThis is not to say we don't get questions on issues to do with WordPress, but we highly recommend you visit the WordPress [support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/) or [online chatroom](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wordpress).\r\n\r\n## How to join the WP Community UK Slack Team\r\n\r\nYou can access the [wp-community-uk](http://wp-community-uk.slack.com) Slack team using a @chat.wordpress.org email address. These are freely available to anyone with a WordPress.org account. \r\n\r\n###1. Get a chat.wordpress.org email address\r\n1.\tTo start, you need a WordPress.org account. If you haven't got one, head to https://wordpress.org/support/register.php and sign up for an account.\r\n2.\tWhen this is done, visit https://chat.wordpress.org, and half way down, under **[Joining the WordPress team on Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/#join)**, you will find a link to be invited to the [Make WordPress Slack team](https://WordPress.slack.com). \r\n3.\tClick on **I understand. Please send me an invite.** (if you understand all above).\r\n4.\tAn email will be sent to you. \r\n5.\tFollow the instructions in the email to create your account for Make WordPress Slack team - the home of all discussions on contributing to the WordPress project. \r\n6.\tYou'll be dropped into the Make WordPress Slack team. From there you can join channels based on where you want to [contribute to WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org) (by clicking on the left hand side under \"Channels\").\r\n\r\n###2. Sign up for an account on wp-community-uk.slack.com\r\nNow armed with your chat.wordpress.org email address, you can sign up for access to the UK community team.\r\n\r\n1.\tGo to https://wp-community-uk.slack.com/signup, and put your wordpress.org username in this box. An email will be sent to your email address.\r\n2.\tClick on **Confirm my Email Address**, and you'll be taken to another username and password box. This can be the same or different to the username & password created for Make WordPress team (step 1.5).\r\n3.\tYou will be taken to the **#general** slack channel. \r\n\r\nIn the UK Slack team, you will find many other channels, including channels for each user/ meetup group. To join any other channels:\r\n\r\n1.\tClick on the \"+X More...\" link under \"Channels\" in the left hand column\r\n2.\tClick on the channel's name to preview it\r\n3.\tClick \"Join Channel\" to join and chat :)\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n### Why do I need to have a chat.wordpress.org email address?\r\nWhen you create a team, Slack only allows you to add new members in two predefined ways:\r\n\r\n1. Invitation only - where as a user you would have to ask for an invitation.\r\n2. Using an email address from a particular domain.\r\n\r\nAs a group, we choose to minic the same standards as the global WordPress team. This also means you now have access to the global WordPress slack team. \r\n\r\n### I signed up for an account at WordPress.slack.com, why do my creditals not work for wp-community-uk.slack.com?\r\nFor each Slack team you need to have an account. \r\n\r\nWe know, it's a pain. At least we only have to go through this process once! \r\n\r\n## Tips\r\nThere are some great tips at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/#help. Some of those tips can be used on this team too. These include: \r\n- [Notifications](https://make.wordpress.org/chat#notifications)\r\n- [Native Desktop and Mobile Apps](https://make.wordpress.org/chat#apps)\r\n- [Gravatars](https://make.wordpress.org/chat#gravatars)\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\nThis channel is not an official WordPress channel, but we do expect all our members to respect each other. That's why we've decided to include a Code of Conduct. This code of conduct is based off the code of conduct that you would see in many WordCamp and across the WordPress community.\r\n\r\nFor this code of conduct, we refer to the administrators of this team:\r\n\r\n>TODO: LIST SLACK ADMINS\r\n\r\n###1.

What To Do If You Witness Or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior\r\n\r\nIf you are subject to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify an administrator as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe administrators are available to help participants, to block offenders, or to otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe on the Slack team.\r\n\r\nYou can contact an administrator privately by clicking on their name under the DIRECT MESSAGES heading on the left hand side of Slack.\r\n\r\n###6.
